[‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà](./README-cn.md)

A feature-rich, modern peer-to-peer (P2P) web chat application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It leverages WebRTC for direct P2P communication, supporting text, file sharing, voice messages, and real-time audio/video/screen-sharing calls, minimizing reliance on central servers after initial peer discovery via a WebSocket-based signaling server. The application also features themed AI assistant contacts with Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities.

**Live Demo:**
https://175.178.216.24/

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+ Modules)
*   **Core P2P Tech:** WebRTC (RTCPeerConnection, RTCDataChannel, MediaStream API)
*   **Signaling:** WebSockets
*   **Local Storage:** IndexedDB
*   **APIs (External, if using AI features):**
    *   OpenAI-compatible API for AI chat completions.
    *   GSV AI Lab (or similar service) for Text-to-Speech.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

1.  **Initialization:** When a user opens the app, a unique User ID is generated or loaded from local storage.
2.  **Signaling:** The client connects to a WebSocket-based signaling server. This server helps peers discover each other and exchange messages (like SDP offers/answers and ICE candidates) needed to establish a direct connection.
3.  **P2P Connection:** Once signaling is complete, a direct WebRTC `RTCPeerConnection` is established between users.
    *   `RTCDataChannel` is used for text messages, file info, voice message data, and group chat messages (relayed by the group owner).
    *   `MediaStreams` are used for audio/video call data.
4.  **Local Persistence:** All contacts, chat messages, and user settings are stored in the browser's IndexedDB, making them available across sessions.
5.  **Group Chat:** Group chats are currently relayed by the group owner. The owner receives messages from members and forwards them to other members in the group.

## üöÄ Quick Start & Installation

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser with WebRTC support (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
*   Java 17 and Maven (if you want to run the provided Spring Boot signaling server).

### 1. Configure the Application

*   Open `js/Config.js` (or `Config.js` in the root directory).
*   **Crucial:** Update the `server` object with your actual URLs and credentials:
    *   `signalingServerUrl`: Your WebSocket signaling server URL. The app might be pre-configured to use `wss://175.178.216.24/signaling`.
    *   `apiEndpoint` (for AI features): Your OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.
    *   `api_key` (for AI features): Your API key for the AI service.
    *   `model` (for AI features): The AI model you want to use.
    *   `ttsApiEndpoint` (for AI features): Your TTS API endpoint (e.g., GSV AI Lab).
    *   `iceServers`: Configure your STUN/TURN server details for NAT traversal. Default settings or examples might be provided (e.g., `turn:175.178.216.24:3478`). **Replace these with your own or trusted public servers.**
*   Adjust other settings in `Config.js` as needed (timeouts, log levels, etc.).

### 2. Signaling Server (Choose one)

*   **Option A: Use a Public Signaling Server (if available and trusted)**
    *   If the `signalingServerUrl` in `js/Config.js` points to an operational public server (like the pre-configured `wss://175.178.216.24/signaling`), you might not need to run your own for initial testing.

*   **Option B: Run the Bundled Spring Boot Signaling Server (`P2P-Web-Chat-Boot`)**
    1.  Clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/git-hub-cc/P2P-Web-Chat.git # Or your specific repository URL
        cd P2P-Web-Chat
        ```
    2.  Navigate to the Spring Boot project directory (e.g., `P2P-Web-Chat-Boot`).
    3.  Build and run the server using Maven:
        ```bash
        mvn spring-boot:run
        ```
        This will typically start the server on `http://localhost:8080`. The WebSocket endpoint will be `ws://localhost:8080/signaling` (or as configured in the Spring Boot app).
    4.  **Important:** If you run your own signaling server, you **must** update `signalingServerUrl` in `js/Config.js` to point to your local server address (e.g., `ws://localhost:8080/signaling`) and modify `api_key` and other configurations as needed.

### 3. Access in Browser

*   Open your browser and navigate to the address where the frontend application is being served (if running the Spring Boot server locally, this is often `http://localhost:8080`, or another address if you deploy static files elsewhere).
*   Open the application in two different browser windows or on two different devices (on the same network if using a local signaling server without NAT traversal configured for it) to test P2P functionality.
*   To ensure P2P connections work between different machines/networks, make sure your signaling server and TURN server are correctly configured and accessible.

## üöÄ Usage

*   **User ID:** A unique User ID is generated and stored on first launch. This ID is used for P2P connections. You can find and copy your ID from the main menu (‚ò∞).
*   **Main Menu (‚ò∞):**
    *   **User ID:** View and copy your User ID.
    *   **Network Status:** Check WebRTC capability and signaling server connection status.
    *   **Preferences:** Toggle auto-connect to contacts.
    *   **AI Server Configuration:** Set API endpoints, keys, and models for AI and TTS.
    *   **Theme & Color Scheme:** Choose your preferred app theme and color mode (Light/Dark/Auto).
    *   **Manual Connect:** Initiate or respond to a manual P2P connection by exchanging SDP (Session Description Protocol) info.
    *   **Danger Zone:** Reset connections, clear contacts, or clear all chat history.
*   **Adding Contacts:**
    *   Click the floating action button (+) to open the "New Chat/Group" modal.
    *   Enter the peer's ID and an optional name to add a contact.
    *   An initial connection attempt will be made.
*   **Creating Groups:**
    *   In the "New Chat/Group" modal, switch to the group tab and enter a group name.
    *   Group members can be managed from the details panel when the group chat is open (by the owner).
*   **Starting Chats/Calls:**
    *   Select a contact or group from the sidebar list.
    *   Use the input field to send text messages.
    *   Use the icons to attach files (üìé), send voice messages (üéôÔ∏è), or initiate video (üìπ), audio (üìû), or screen-sharing (üñ•Ô∏è) calls.
*   **AI Contacts:**
    *   Special AI contacts are pre-loaded based on the selected theme.
    *   Interact with them like regular contacts.
    *   Their TTS settings can be configured in the details panel (‚ìò).
*   **Details Panel (‚ìò):**
    *   View contact/group information.
    *   Clear chat history for the current chat.
    *   Delete contact, leave/disband group (owner permission).
    *   Manage group members (if group owner).
    *   Configure TTS for AI contacts.

## üé® Theming

The application supports a flexible theming system:

*   **Theme Files:**
    *   CSS files are located in the `css/` directory (e.g., `Genshin Impact-light.css`, `Battle Through the Heavens-dark.css`). These define the visual appearance.
    *   JavaScript data files are in the `data/` directory (e.g., `Genshin Impact.js`, `Battle Through the Heavens.js`). These define theme-specific `SPECIAL_CONTACTS_DEFINITIONS`, including AI characters, initial messages, system prompts, and default TTS configurations.
*   **Theme Selection:**
    *   Themes can be selected from the main menu (‚ò∞).
    *   Selection includes base theme and color scheme (Light, Dark, Auto).
    *   `ThemeLoader.js` handles loading the appropriate CSS and JS data files based on user choice and system preference (for "Auto" mode).
*   **Adding a New Theme:**
    1.  Create new CSS files for your theme in the `css/` directory (e.g., `mytheme-light.css`, `mytheme-dark.css`). Define custom CSS variables and styles.
    2.  (Optional) If your theme has unique AI characters, create a new JS data file in `data/` (e.g., `mytheme.js`) defining `SPECIAL_CONTACTS_DEFINITIONS`.
    3.  Register your theme in the `ThemeLoader.themes` object in `ThemeLoader.js`.
