[‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà](./README-cn.md)

A feature-rich, modern Peer-to-Peer (P2P) web chat application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend, and Java Spring Boot for the backend. It utilizes WebRTC for direct P2P communication, supporting text, file sharing, voice messages, and real-time audio/video/screen-sharing calls. Initial peer discovery is handled by a WebSocket-based signaling server (implemented in Java Spring Boot). P2P communication minimizes reliance on a central server (except for signaling and optional TURN relay services), while AI chat and TTS functionalities are proxied through the backend to external services. The application is deeply integrated with themable AI assistant contacts featuring Text-to-Speech (TTS), dynamic context (like daily random events and moods), and smart summarization for long conversations, offering a more vivid interactive experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+ Modules)
*   **Backend:** Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring WebFlux (for AI interfaces), Spring WebSocket, Maven
*   **Core P2P Tech:** WebRTC (RTCPeerConnection, RTCDataChannel, MediaStream API)
*   **Signaling:** WebSockets
*   **NAT Traversal:** STUN/TURN (Coturn recommended)
*   **Local Storage:** IndexedDB (Frontend)
*   **External Service APIs (via Backend Proxy):**
    *   OpenAI-compatible API for AI chat completions.
    *   TTS API (e.g., GSV AI Lab or other compatible services) for Text-to-Speech.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

1.  **Initialization:** When a user opens the application, a unique User ID is generated or loaded from local storage.
2.  **Signaling:** The client connects to a WebSocket-based signaling server (provided by the Spring Boot application). This server helps peers discover each other and exchange messages (like SDP offers/answers and ICE candidates) needed to establish a direct connection. ICE candidates may include public IP addresses obtained via STUN servers or relay addresses via TURN servers if needed.
3.  **P2P Connection:** Once signaling is complete, a direct WebRTC `RTCPeerConnection` is established between users. If direct connection fails (e.g., due to symmetric NAT), media streams will attempt to be relayed using the configured TURN server.
    *   `RTCDataChannel` is used for text messages, file info, voice message data, and group chat messages (relayed by the group owner).
    *   `MediaStreams` are used for audio/video call data.
4.  **AI Chat & TTS:**
    *   When a user chats with an AI character, the request is sent to the Spring Boot backend.
    *   The backend service first processes the context (e.g., injecting daily dynamic events/moods, or summarizing long conversations), then calls the configured external Large Language Model API.
    *   The AI's reply (text) is further processed by the backend to generate speech using a TTS service.
    *   Finally, the text and speech (usually an audio URL) are returned to the frontend for display and playback, either streamed or via regular HTTP response.
5.  **Local Persistence:** All contacts, chat messages, and user settings are stored locally in the browser's IndexedDB, making them available across sessions.
6.  **Group Chat:** Group chats are currently relayed by the group owner. The owner receives messages from members and forwards them to other members in the group.

## üöÄ Quick Start & Installation

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser with WebRTC support (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
*   Java 17 and Maven (for running the Spring Boot backend server).
*   Docker (recommended for running the TURN server).

### 1. Configure the Application

*   **Frontend Configuration (`js/Config.js`):**
    *   `signalingServerUrl`: Your WebSocket signaling server URL. Should point to your Spring Boot backend (e.g., `ws://localhost:8080/signaling` or `wss://your-domain.com/signaling`).
    *   `iceServers`: Configure your STUN/TURN server details for NAT traversal. **It is highly recommended to deploy your own TURN server (e.g., Coturn) for optimal connection success rates.**
    *   `apiEndpoint` (for AI): Should point to the `/v1/chat/completions` proxy endpoint provided by your Spring Boot backend.
    *   `ttsApiEndpoint` (for AI): Should point to the TTS proxy endpoint provided by your Spring Boot backend (if the backend proxies TTS).
*   **Backend Configuration (Spring Boot `application.properties` or `application.yml`):**
    *   `openai.api.base_url`: The base URL for your OpenAI-compatible API.
    *   `openai.api.api_key`: Your API key for the OpenAI-compatible API.
    *   `openai.api.model`: The AI model name you intend to use.
    *   `app.summary_prompt`: The prompt used for conversation summarization.
    *   `app.event_mood_prompt`: The prompt used for generating daily events/moods for AI characters.
    *   (If backend proxies TTS) `your.tts.api.url`: Your TTS service URL.
    *   `allowed.url`: CORS allowed frontend origin.
    *   `api.v1.request.limit`: Daily request limit for API v1 paths.
    *   WebSocket related configurations (buffer sizes, timeouts).
*   Adjust other settings as needed.

### 2. Deploy a TURN Server (Recommended)

For reliable P2P connections in complex network environments (like symmetric NAT), deploying a TURN server is highly recommended. This project provides a `docker-compose.yml` and an example `turnserver.conf` file for use with Coturn.

1.  Edit `turnserver.conf`, setting the `realm` (usually your server's public IP or domain) and `user` (username and password).
2.  In the directory containing `docker-compose.yml` and `turnserver.conf`, run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
3.  Configure your TURN server details (URL, username, password) in the frontend `js/Config.js` under `iceServers`.

### 3. Run the Backend Server

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/git-hub-cc/P2P-Web-Chat.git # Or your specific repository URL
    cd P2P-Web-Chat
    ```
2.  Navigate to the Spring Boot project directory (e.g., `P2P-Web-Chat-Boot`, if backend code is there).
3.  Ensure your `application.properties` (or `.yml`) file is correctly configured with API keys and URLs as described above.
4.  Build and run the server using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    This will typically start the server on `http://localhost:8080` (or the port configured in `application.properties`). The WebSocket endpoint will be `ws://localhost:8080/signaling`, and the AI proxy endpoint will be `http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions`.

### 4. Access the Frontend in a Browser

*   Deploy the frontend static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, data, music) to any HTTP server (e.g., Nginx, Apache, or use Node.js's `http-server`).
*   Alternatively, if Spring Boot is configured to serve static content, you might be able to access it directly via `http://localhost:8080`.
*   **Important:** Ensure that `signalingServerUrl` and `apiEndpoint` (and possibly `ttsApiEndpoint`) in the frontend's `js/Config.js` point to the correct address and port of your running Spring Boot backend server.
*   Open the application in two different browser windows or on two different devices to test P2P functionality.

## üöÄ Usage

## üé® Theming

The application supports a flexible theming system:

*   **Theme Files:**
    *   CSS files are located in the `css/` directory (e.g., `Genshin Impact-light.css`, `Battle Through the Heavens-dark.css`). These define the visual appearance.
    *   JavaScript data files are located in the `data/` directory (e.g., `Genshin Impact.js`, `Battle Through the Heavens.js`). These define `SPECIAL_CONTACTS_DEFINITIONS` for specific themes, including AI characters, initial messages, system prompts, and default TTS configurations.
*   **Theme Selection:**
    *   Themes can be selected from the main menu (‚ò∞).
    *   Selection includes base themes and color schemes (Light, Dark, Auto).
    *   `ThemeLoader.js` handles loading the appropriate CSS and JS data files based on user selection and system preference (for "Auto" mode).
*   **Adding New Themes:**
    1.  Create new CSS files for your theme in the `css/` directory (e.g., `mytheme-light.css`, `mytheme-dark.css`). Define custom CSS variables and styles.
    2.  (Optional) If your theme has unique AI characters, create a new JS data file in the `data/` directory (e.g., `mytheme.js`) defining `SPECIAL_CONTACTS_DEFINITIONS`.
    3.  Register your theme in the `ThemeLoader.themes` object in `ThemeLoader.js`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Helper Tools & Scripts

This project includes several Python helper scripts for development and maintenance:

*   `delete_minified_files.py`:
    *   **Function:** Scans a specified directory (defaults to current) and its subdirectories to find and delete all files with `.min.html`, `.min.js`, or `.min.css` suffixes.
    *   **Use:** Cleans up old minified files before re-minification or when minified versions are not needed.
    *   **Run:** `python delete_minified_files.py`, will prompt for directory.
*   `minify_and_replace.py`:
    *   **Function:**
        1.  **Minify Files:** Recursively scans the current directory, minifies `.js`, `.css`, `.html` files using `jsmin`, `rcssmin`, `htmlmin` libraries, and generates corresponding `.min.*` files. Skips minification if a `.min.*` file exists and is newer than the source.
        2.  **Content Replacement:** In specified minified files (`index.min.html`, `js/ThemeLoader.min.js`), uses regular expressions to replace references to `.js`, `.css`, `.html` files with references to their `.min.*` versions.
    *   **Use:** Automates the process of minifying frontend assets and updating references, reducing deployment size and improving load times.
    *   **Run:** `python minify_and_replace.py` (ensure dependencies are installed: `pip install jsmin rcssmin htmlmin`).
*   `resize_images.py`:
    *   **Function:** Scans all `.png` images in the current directory and its subdirectories, resizes them to a target width (default 130px) while maintaining aspect ratio. **This script overwrites original images.**
    *   **Use:** Standardizes image dimensions, reduces image file sizes, and optimizes assets.
    *   **Run:** `python resize_images.py` (ensure Pillow library is installed: `pip install Pillow`).
*   `test_stun_servers.py`:
    *   **Function:** Loads a list of STUN servers from `stun_servers.txt`, concurrently tests each server for connectivity, latency, and attempts to retrieve public IP and port. Finally, sorts servers by success rate and average latency, outputting the best performing ones.
    *   **Use:** Helps users select the most stable and fastest STUN servers for WebRTC NAT traversal.
    *   **Run:** `python test_stun_servers.py`. Requires a `stun_servers.txt` file (format `host:port`, one per line) in the same directory.

## üí° Future Enhancements

*   **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** Implement symmetric encryption (e.g., AES) for DataChannel messages on top of the inherent DTLS security for true E2EE of chat content.
*   **Decentralized Group Chat:**
    *   Explore full-mesh P2P connections for smaller groups.
    *   Investigate GossipSub-like protocols (e.g., inspired by libp2p-gossipsub) for more scalable and resilient group messaging.
*   **Group Audio/Video Calls:** Integrate an SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) or MCU (Multipoint Conferencing Unit) to support multi-party audio/video calls, as WebRTC mesh is inefficient for many participants.
*   **Offline Messaging:** Potentially if the signaling server can queue messages for offline users.
*   **User Status:** More detailed online/offline/typing indicators.
*   **Message Status:** Sent/delivered/read receipts.
*   **Advanced AI Interactions:** E.g., AI characters initiating conversations, remembering long-term user preferences.
